# Homework 1 Submission - Avery Peiffer
## Avery Peiffer

I have zipped all of my homework files into one `.zip` folder for ease of submission. My code is in `hw1-aep65.py` and the submission files that Dr. Kovashka asked for are in the `submission_files` directory. If you need to run my code, feel free to uncomment any of lines 339-343; these lines call a function for each step of the assignment. However, the `part_g()` function will call all of the other functions, so just running this one is satisfactory.

Please email me at aep65@pitt.edu if there are any issues with my submission, and I will try to fix them as soon as possible. Thank you for reviewing my submission!
