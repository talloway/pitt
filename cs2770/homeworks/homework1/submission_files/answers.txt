For which of the three representations is the within-between ratio smallest?
	The within-between ratio is smallest for the texture_repr_concats representation.
Does the answer to this question depend on the value of k that you use?
	No - the bag of words representation can vary based on the value of k, but it does not change enough to affect the answer to the previous question.
Does it depend on the number of keypoints you extract? (Try 500, 1000, 2000, 3000.)
	No, it does not depend on the number of keypoints extracted.
Which of the three types of descriptors that you used is the best one? How can you tell?
	The texture_repr_concats descriptor is the best because its ratio is the smallest.
Is this what you expected? Why or why not?
	No, I would have expected the bag of words descriptor to be the best. However, it seems feasible that it is not the best.
	The different animals seem to have differing texture patterns, but have some of the same features (eyes, ears, etc.) so
	it makes sense that the bag of words descriptor is not actually the best for these images.
