Additional comments to the grader:
  My driver program pauses for 1.5 seconds after it prints out the result of an operation. I did this to make the result easier to see before the program prints
  out the entire menu again.
  Biconnected.java is not part of my final submission. I had it for a previous submission, but decided that I did not want to use it. I locked it so that it isn't
  used.
  You may need to compile all the files separately. I've had issues where compiling my NetworkAnalysis.java file doesn't cause all of the other files to be
  compiled as well.
