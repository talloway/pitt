Name: Avery Peiffer

Lecture section: T/Th 2:30 PM - 3:45 PM

Recitation day and time: W 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM

Assignment #: 1

Program due date: 9/25, 11:59 P.M.

Handed in date: 9/25

Source code file name(s): ac_test.java, DLBtrie.java, LinkedList.java, Node.java







Other file name(s) (if relevant):







Does your program run without error?: No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
The one error that I have noticed while testing is if the user enters a string of characters such as "aardxczaskd",
the program finds no predictions when the user enters 'x'. However, after several additional characters
are entered after the one that doesn't return any predictions, it will start predicting nonsense words like "aardxczaskdvark", as if
it is trying to predict the word "aardvark." I haven't noticed any other errors, but it's possible I missed some corner cases
when I was testing.








Additional comments to the grader: Parts of LinkedList.java and Node.java were modified from Professor Hoffman's
starter files from CS 0445. This code provided outlines for how to set up the Node and LinkedList classes, but was
expanded upon significantly for the purposes of this project.
