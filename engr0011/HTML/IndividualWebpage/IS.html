		<h2 align = "center"> Interesting Professional Society </h2>

		<p> <center> The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is an professional society that is affiliated with both electrical and computer engineering, the latter of which I will pursue in the Swanson school. </center> </p>

		<ul>
			<li> Who are the members of this society? </li> <ul>
				<li> Size of membership: <b> 420.000 </b> </li>
				<li> Members can be students or professionals, mostly in electrical and electronics engineering, but the organization has attracted professionals in many other engineering disciplines. </li> </ul>
			<li> Why does this association exist? </li> <ul>
				<li> Services: The IEEE provides learning opportunities within engineering and technology, such as the <i> IEEE e Learning Library</i>, a collection of online courses for self-paced learning. </li>
				<li> Conferences: The IEEE sponsors more than 1,600 conferences and meetings worldwide each year. </li>
				<li> Publications: IEEE produces over 30% of electrical and computer engineering literature, publishing over 100 peer-reviewed journals. </li> </ul>
			<li> Becoming a member </li> <ul>
				<li> I would join the IEEE because of its network of members around the world, which would give me opportunities to connect with a large number of professionals who are all doing research in the fields of electrical and computer engineering. Membership would be helpful to me as an <u> engineer </u> because I would have access to IEEE's many resources for conducting research in the field. </li>
