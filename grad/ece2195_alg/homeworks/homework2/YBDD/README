The files:

Makefile 	-  This file contains the compiler commands
bdd.cxx 	-  This file contains all the functions to support the
                   commandline interface.There is a "help" command for
		   a list of all available YBDD commands.
bdd_functs.h 	-  This file contains all the methods necessary to create
		   a working BDD package. The methods which need to be
		   filled in are contained below. Please do not change
	  	   the interfaces to these functions, as they are called
		   by the command line processor.
bdd_node.h 	-  This file contains the BDD nodes structure class which
         	   includes the methods and variables used to represent
                   the BDD nodes.

How to run YBDD:
--------------------------------------------------------
The included Makefile will run the necessary compiler commands
and options. Simply run the command "make" to compile your code.
Then run the command "YBDD" to begin the YBDD command line interface.

The following is a list of supported YBDD commands:
boolean <list of var names>
eval <dest> <expr>
source <filename>
bdd <funct>
size <funct>
total <funct>
quit


What you need to do to complete the YBDD:
--------------------------------------------------------
The following empty routines within bdd_functs.h must be completed:

    bdd_node *Zero() {    }
    bdd_node *One()  {    }
    bdd_node *newVar(char *label) {    }
    bdd_node *ITE(bdd_node *I, bdd_node *T, bdd_node *E) {   }
    bdd_node *NOT(bdd_node *f) {    }
    bdd_node *AND(bdd_node *f, bdd_node *g) {    }
    bdd_node *OR(bdd_node *f, bdd_node *g)  {    }
    bdd_node *XOR(bdd_node *f, bdd_node *g) {    }
