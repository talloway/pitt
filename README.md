# University of Pittsburgh - Avery Peiffer

This repository encompasses the courses I took during my undergraduate career (Fall 2017 - Spring 2021) as well as during my graduate career (Fall 2021 - Spring 2022). The 2000-level courses are graduate courses.

* Note: I have divided the repo up by academic year. Summer courses count as part of the previous year's academic year. So COE 1530, which
I took in the Summer 2020 term, is assigned to the 2019-2020 school year folder.

Courses not included in this repository because I ended up not having any files on my computer for them:
* COE 0031: Linear Circuits and Systems 1 - Fall 2018
