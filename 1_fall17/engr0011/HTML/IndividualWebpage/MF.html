			<p> A licensed professional engineer is someone that has proved their ability to handle responsibility and consider problems in a competent manner. To be licensed, an engineer must earn a four-year degree in engineering, pass the Fundamentals of Engineering exam, complete four years of experience under a PE, and pass the Principles and Practice exam. I think it would be important to become a registered engineer because of what a professional license says about you without having to speak for yourself. It shows that you are a competent engineer who is clearly devoted to the line of work, and signals to employers and peers that you can handle responsibility.   </p>

			<p> Engineers work in very high-stakes environments. Many times, the decisions of engineers can directly result in deaths. It is critical that every engineer is able to uphold the responsibility he or she possesses: to make decisions that benefit, and not harm, others. Becoming a registered engineer shows that someone not only understands the responsibility he or she holds, but is willing to take on that responsibility by going through many programs to become registered. Requiring engineers to become registered before they can make decisions that have an immense impact on society allows for only the most capable and willing to work in the profession. </p>
