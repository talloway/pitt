WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net lab_3_i/top_level_0/U0/mul/c/EN_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin lab_3_i/top_level_0/U0/mul/c/D_reg[31]_i_2/O, cell lab_3_i/top_level_0/U0/mul/c/D_reg[31]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
