# This is in the MIPS assembly format that I'm used to from COE 0147
# Assume dividend is in $r1 and divisor is in $r2
# I.e. for 21 / 5, 21 is in $r1 and 5 is in $r2

# Initialize count to 0
addi $r3, $r3, 0

subtraction:
    # Perform repeated subtraction and increment the count
    sub $r1, $r1, $r2
    addi $r3, $r3, 1

    # Subtract the divisor from the result so it can be compared to see if it is < 0
    sub $r4, $r1, $r2
    bltzal $r4, end
    j subtraction


# Reaching this point means $r1, which contains the result of repeated subtraction, is 
# less than the divisor, meaning division has ended.
# $r3 contains the quotient, while $r1 contains the remainder.

    # Clear out values in special registers HI and LO
