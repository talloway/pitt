I created the initial design of the processor last weekend but because of my finals schedule, I was forced to do most of the actual testing on 4/24. As a result, I was not able to test the processor as thoroughly as I would have liked. I am confident that standalone arithmetic instructions, the branch instructions, put/halt, and the shift instructions are working correctly. From my surface-level testing, I believe that load word/store word and the jump instructions do not work. I also encountered problems when chaining together arithmetic instructions. I tried to do ADDI r0, 3 and then ADDI r0, 2 but was getting an answer of FFFE. I couldn't figure out the source of this issue, which affected most of the test cases that were provided in the project files. If my schedule over the past few weeks was slightly more generous, I likely could have tested this issue heavily and found its source.
