  <h2 align = "center"> <b> History of Prosthetics</b> </h2> <!-- A definition list containing a rough timeline of the history of prosthetics -->
  <dl>
    <dt> Before 1 B.C. </dt>
      <dd> Various artificial legs have been unearthed in Europe that have dated to Ancient Roman times.
        These legs were often made of bronze and iron, with a wooden core so as to retain the ability to move freely. </dd>
    <dt> Year 0 - 1000 A.D. </dt>
      <dd> Most prosthetics developed during this time were for battle injuries. They often did not emphasize functionality;
        just giving a person balance was enough. Hand hooks and peg legs were also developed during this time. </dd>
    <dt> The Renaissance </dt>
      <dd> The increased interest in science and medicine during the Renaissance led many to reinvent the concept of prosthetics.
        <ul> <!-- A nested unordered list containing multiple events in one specific time period concerning prosthetics. -->
          <li> German mercenary Gotz van Berlichingen had a pair of iron hands made after he lost his right arm.
            The hands could be manipulated by a series of releases and springs. </li>
          <li> French surgeon Ambroise Pare introduced modern amputation procedures and made new prostheses that contain engineering
            features used today. </li>
          <li> Pieter Verduyn developed the first nonlocking below-knee prosthesis which would go on to become the model for
            current joint devices. </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    <dt> Modern Times </dt>
      <dd> The high number of casualties in the U.S. Civil War led to many developments in the field of prosthetics.
        Following World War I, the American Orthotic & Prosthetic Association (AOPA) was created to discuss and develop prostheses.
        After World War II, military companies shifted their focus from improving weapons to improving prosthetic function.
        Devices today are much lighter and much more functional than before. </dd> <br />
