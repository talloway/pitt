		<p> Engineers are people who solve problems for a living. They work in all industries in a variety of positions, where they apply principles of math and science to find new and creative solutions to challenging technical problems. </p>

		<p> Engineers can work in many fields, from medicine to communications to aerospace to consumer products. They often apply for and receive a professional license after several years in the workforce, at which point they are able to make impactful decisions to solve problems. </p> </font> </font> </font>

		<p> Computer engineering is the study of both the hardware and software present in computers. Computer hardware engineers research, design, develop, and test computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers. They usually work in research laboratories in testing various models. </p>

		<p> By contrast, software developers develop the applications that allow people to do specific tasks on an electronic device, or develop the systems that run the device. Software developers work for firms that deal in the design and manufacturing of computer systems. </p>

		<ol type=i> Careers in Computer Engineering:
			<li> Network & Computer System Admin </li>
			<li> Software Developers </li>
			<li> Computer Network Support Specialists </li>
			<li> Computer Network Architects </li>
			<li> Computer Hardware Engineers </li>
