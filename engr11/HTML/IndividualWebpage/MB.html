			<font size = "-1"> <font face = "Arial"> <font color = "#1c2957"> <p align = "center"> My name is Avery Peiffer. I am from Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Harrisburg, the state capital. The area is nowhere near as populated as Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, but there is still a lot going on. Hershey, the town named for the chocolate, is a ten minute drive from Harrisburg. The suburbs of Harrisburg are pretty expansive, but outside of them is nothing but farmland until basically Pittsburgh or Philadelphia. Also fairly close to my area is Lancaster, which is famous for its high concentration of Amish people. Harrisburg is famous for being the location for The Pennsylvania Farm Show, which is the country's largest indoor agriculture exposition and attracts over 500,000 visitors each year. Harrisburg is also well-known because it is close to Three Mile Island, where the most significant nuclear power plant in US history occurred in 1979. So yeah, there almost was no Harrisburg. My mom went to school within the ten-mile radius of TMI, so I wouldn't be alive if that accident had more serious consequences. </p>

			<p align = "center"> I'm in the Swanson School of Engineering, but I still don't know what I really want to do with my life. I figured that a degree in engineering would be the most versatile for finding different jobs after I graduate, and it seems like that is the case at this point. But probably the biggest reason for continuing to pursue engineering is the convenience of having an Einstein's close by. Bagels are really good. I don't think it is an understatement to say that bagels can be more enjoyable than some people. Literally my laptop background right now is a bagel. That has been the main driving force for my choice in major. There's another Einstein's in Posvar Hall, so my backup major is Political Science. If a cult approached me and told me I would get free bagels for joining I would not hesitate. That's how serious I am about bagels.
