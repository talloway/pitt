#21	The amount of time it takes to solve large Boggle boards increases too drastically to complete in a normal amount of time. A heuristic allows us to solve a large Boggle board in a more reasonable amount of time.
#22	If we upsize the array by one, we have to discard (N^2+N)/2 chunks of memory each time; when we double the size, we only discard N - 1 chunks of memory. Also, as arrays get larger, the upsizing is called less frequently if we double each time.
