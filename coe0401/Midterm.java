#21    For a word with n letters, there are n! permutations of that word.
        For words of moderate length and longer, there are too many permutations
        for a computer to search them all.
#22    It is more efficient to upsize the array to double the size then reduce
        size at the end. This is almost always better than upsizing by one every
        time (upsizing by one is only better in extreme cases).
