			<br /> <h4 align = "center"> Things I like to do </h4> <font size = "-1">
			<ol>
				<li> Play Spikeball </li>
				<li> Watch Bob Ross </li>
				<li> Play Fifa </li>

			<h4 align = "center"> Why I love college </h4> <font size = "-1">
			<dl>
				<dt> Dining hall food
				<dd> I really like having an essentially unlimited supply of food in the dining halls. I'm not under any pressure to eat certain things to make sure that I'm 				getting a full meal. The staff at the dining halls are also very nice. </dd>
				<dt> Spaced out classes
				<dd> Having free time between classes is really nice to relax and refocus before the next class. I think I'm able to learn better here than I was in high 				school because I'm more refreshed for class. </dd>
				<dt> Free Stuff 
				<dd> I've received a lot of things here that I never would think about buying for myself. I have so many t-shirts and small towels from the football games 				now. </dd>
				<dt> Access to the city
				<dd> Pittsburgh has a lot to offer, so it's great that we get access to the entire city with our student ID. The free bus fare does a lot to make sure that 				we are not prohibited from seeing all the different parts of Pittsburgh because of cost. </dd>
				<dt> Classes are more serious
				<dd> High schools were frustrating because of their emphasis on repetition of concepts, often beating them into the ground for memorization. Here classes are 				much more based on concepts and intuition - I know that I don't have to be perfect in all of the little details so long as I understand the underlying 				concept. </dd>
				<dt> Sporting events	
				<dd> Even though our football team hasn't been amazing this year, it's still a fun experience to go to Heinz Field and be in the student section. There is a 				lot of school pride there, which makes it a really cool place. </dd>

			<h4 align = "center"> Jobs I would like to do when I grow up </h4> <font size = "-1">
			<ul>
				<li> Software engineer </li>
				<li> Data Scientist </li>
				<li> Stevedore </li>
				<li> Mathematician </li>
				<li> Computer System Architect </li>
				<li> Actuary </li>
			</ul> </font>

			<h4 align = "center"> Things I have learned about college </h4> <font size = "-1">
			<ul>
				<li> The work in college classes is much different than in high school. There is really no busy work; it's all based on understanding concepts. </li>
				<li> The professors in college are a lot nicer than they are made out to be. They are very helpful if you make an effort to approach them, and they are all 				interested in helping their students learn. </li>
				<li> I learned that balancing school and social activities is definitely possible, but it takes considerable effort. If I devote my full attention to my 				work, I will end up with free time to spend doing other things. </li>
