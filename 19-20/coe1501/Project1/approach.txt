My approach to tracking the user's previously entered words was to add each of the user's words into a separate
DLB Trie (userHistoryTrie). Then, when a new character is entered, the program searches through the history trie
and retrieves all words that start with the current string that is being formed. It then orders these words by frequency
using two ArrayLists and a HashMap.
