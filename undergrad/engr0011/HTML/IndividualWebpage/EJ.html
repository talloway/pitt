				<dt> Computer Network Architect
				<dd> <font color = "Green"> <font face = "Times"> <font size = "-1"> 
				<p> Computer network architects build communication networks for data, from networks between two computers to large wide-area networks. They are also heavily involved with information security, as they must consider the possible vulnerabilities of the networks they create. Network architects also perform research in new networking technologies to further advance the field. </p>
				<p> Computer network architects typically have a bachelor's degree in a field related to computers, as well as experience in the field of networking. They usually work in offices, taking an occasional trip to a server room when they need access to the hardware that makes up a network. </p>

				<dt> Software Developer
				<dd> <font color = "Crimson"> <font face = "Papyrus"> <font size = "+1"> 
				<p> Software developers develop the underlying systems of a computer as well as the programs that run on those systems. They respond to customer feedback by testing and improving software to meet their needs, and continually perform tests to maintain that software. They make their software with the intention of it being used by many people who are not necessarily fluent in computer programming, so software developers must be very focused on the user experience with their software. </p>
				<p> Most software developers have a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field. Software developers work in a variety of industries, from systems design to finance to manufacturing. They often work in teams to optimize the process of designing and implementing software, and usually do so in an office.
