	<p> My name is Avery Peiffer. I am a freshman in the Swanson School of Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, and I am originally from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. <font color= "Red"> <font face="Papyrus"> I will most likely pursue computer engineering in the Swanson school. </font> </font> I played soccer at my high school and participated in a number of extracurricular activities, including Technology Student Association (TSA) and National Honor Society. I invest a probably unhealthy amount of time into my fantasy football teams, but I have received relatively good returns at this point in the football season. In my four leagues, I am a combined 21-11 (.656 winning percentage), which suggests that I am at least better than a coin flip over this sample size. My main league is a 12-team league with all of my friends from high school. In that league, I'm 1-7. In a different 12-team league, my team has a record of 5-3. I am also in two 8-team leagues, where I am 8-0 and 7-1, respectively. I've pretty much lost hope for my team in my main league, but I'm hoping to get my other three teams into the playoffs. I wouldn't say fantasy football is easy or entirely dependent on luck. While there is definitely a degree of luck that factors into how a season can go, I can minimize my dependence on luck by making informed decisions. s </p>

<!-- Description of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers -->

	<ul>
		<li> Who are the members of this society? </li>
			<ul>
				<li> Size of membership: <b> 420,000 </b> </li>
				<li> Members can be students or professionals, mostly in electrical and electronics engineering, but the organization has attracted people in many other disciplines of engineering. </li> 	
			</ul>
		
		<li> Why does this association exist? </li>
			<ul>
				<li> Services: The IEEE provides learning opportunities within engineering and technology, such as the <i> IEEE e Learning Library </i>, a collection of online courses for self-paced learning. </li>
				<li> Conferences: The IEEE sponsors more than 1,600 conferences and meetings worldwide each year. </li>
				<li> Publications: IEEE produces over 30% of electrical and computer engineering literature, publishing over 100 peer-reviewed journals. </li>
			</ul>

		<li> Becoming a member </li>
			<ul>
				<li> I would join the IEEE because of its network of members around the world, which would give me opportunities to connect with a large number of professionals who are all doing research in the fields of electrical and computer engineering. Membership would be helpful to me as an <u> engineer </u> because I would have access to IEEE's many resources for cutting-edge research in the field. </li>
			</ul>

<!-- Things that I love about college. -->

	<dl> <font size=+2> <font color = "Maroon"> <font face = "Helvetica">
		<dt> Dining Hall food
		<dd> I've never really had consistent access to an essentially unlimited supply of food. I really enjoy the fact that I can swipe in to a dining hall, and stay as long as I want, taking advantage of the food availability there. The dining halls also have a great mix of food that allows me to try new options without the risk of not liking anything at all. The staff at the dining halls are all very nice and make for a pleasant experience, as well. </dd>

		<dt> Spaced out classes
		<dd> The most difficult part of high school was getting up early in the morning for seven consecutive hours of classes. I would want nothing more than to take a break and relax in the middle of the day. Here I am able to plan my schedule to include such things, where I often have a sizable chunk of time free around lunchtime to relax or get anything done that is necessary. </dd>

		<dt> Free Stuff
		<dd> The amount of things that I've received here that I would never buy for myself is astounding. I'm paying a lot of money to be here, but a lot of the events sanctioned by the university give out cool things like food and t-shirts, so I guess that about even things out. </dd>

		<dt> Access to the city
		<dd> Pittsburgh has a lot to offer, and we are given freedom to explore it with our student ID. We are able to get into any of the nearby museums, and the free bus fare we get is definitely very useful, as we can just casually go somewhere in the city without worrying about the costs of transportation. </dd>

		<dt> Classes are more serious
		<dd> It was very frustrating in high school to have to constantly be doing assignments for material that I had already learned. It always felt like a huge waste of time. In college, the classes are structured moreso to a fixed pace, leaving the responsibility of mastering the class material to me.</dd>

		<dt> Sporting events
		<dd> Even though our football team isn't the best in the country this year, it is still a lot of fun to go to games and be in the student section. I think we collectively have much more school pride here than we did at our individual high schools, and that shows during the games. </dd>

<!-- List of things that I have learned about college. -->

	<ul>
		<li> I thought college classes would be tough, with a lot of work, and I was definitely right. I'm doing more work than I ever did in high school. </li>
		<li> I had this preconception that college professors would be cold, unhelpful individuals who didn't really care about how their students did. Actually, all of my professors are very nice people who are passionate about their subjects and want to share that passion with their students. </li>
		<li> I discovered that it is definitely possible to balance academics and have time for social activities. If I put in some solid time in getting my work done, I will be able to comfortably enjoy time with my friends. </li>
